## Simple API Server Usage & Endpoint Conventions

The included `scripts/simple_api_server.py` provides a minimal HTTP API for accessing spending and recommendation data from the SQLite database. This is intended for demo and hackathon judging purposes.

### Supported Endpoints (Strict Matching)
- `GET /api/v1/spending` ‚Äî List all spending records
- `GET /api/v1/spending/<transaction_id>` ‚Äî Get a specific spending record by ID
- `GET /api/v1/recommendations` ‚Äî List all recommendations
- `GET /api/v1/recommendations/<id>` ‚Äî Get a specific recommendation by ID

**Important Notes:**
- Endpoints are case-sensitive and do not support trailing slashes (e.g., `/api/v1/spending/` will NOT work).
- Only the above patterns are supported. Typos, extra slashes, or unsupported paths will return `{ "detail": "Endpoint not found" }`.
- If you request a valid endpoint with a non-existent ID, you will receive `{ "detail": "Spending record not found" }` or `{ "detail": "Recommendation not found" }`.

### Example URLs (assuming server runs on port 8080):
- List all spending: [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/spending](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/spending)
- Get a specific spending record: [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/spending/TXN1002](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/spending/TXN1002)
- List all recommendations: [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/recommendations](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/recommendations)
- Get a specific recommendation: [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/recommendations/REC1002](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/recommendations/REC1002)

### What Will NOT Work
- `/api/v1/spending/` (trailing slash)
- `/api/v1/Spending` (case mismatch)
- `/api/v1/recommendation/REC1002` (typo in path)
- `/api/v1/recommendations/REC9999` (non-existent ID)

### Troubleshooting
- If you receive an error, check that you are using the exact endpoint and a valid ID as listed by the `/api/v1/spending` or `/api/v1/recommendations` endpoints.
- The server does not support flexible or RESTful conventions beyond those listed above.

## üöÄ HP AI Studio Integration

This project is integrated with HP AI Studio for model training, tracking, and deployment. We provide a CLI-based approach that meets all hackathon requirements while working around potential desktop app limitations.

### Why CLI Integration?

We've implemented a command-line interface (CLI) for HP AI Studio integration to address potential issues with the desktop application, such as:

- Workspace startup hangs or freezes
- Dependency conflicts between project requirements and HP AI Studio
- Path resolution issues with nested project structures
- Environment variable conflicts

Our CLI approach ensures reliable integration while maintaining all the benefits of HP AI Studio's MLflow tracking, model registry, and deployment capabilities.

### HP AI Studio Integration Script

The `hp_ai_studio_integration.py` script provides a comprehensive command-line interface for HP AI Studio integration:

```bash
# Run all integration steps (train, register, create deployment config)
python hp_ai_studio_integration.py --all

# Or run individual steps
python hp_ai_studio_integration.py --train      # Train and log model to MLflow
python hp_ai_studio_integration.py --register   # Register model in HP AI Studio registry
python hp_ai_studio_integration.py --deploy-config  # Create deployment configuration
```

### Step-by-Step Integration Guide

#### 1. Environment Setup

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r models/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure MLflow tracking URI**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your HP AI Studio MLflow tracking URI:
   ```
   MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=https://your-hp-ai-studio-mlflow-uri
   ```
   
   You can find this URI in your HP AI Studio workspace settings or in the MLflow tracking server configuration.

#### 2. Training and Logging the Model

1. **Run the training script**
   ```bash
   python hp_ai_studio_integration.py --train
   ```

2. **What happens during training**:
   - The script initializes the SpendingRecommender model
   - Loads sample data (or generates synthetic data if not available)
   - Trains the model on the data
   - Logs model parameters, metrics, and artifacts to MLflow
   - Saves example inputs and outputs for documentation
   - Returns a run ID for tracking

#### 3. Registering the Model

1. **Register the model in HP AI Studio's model registry**
   ```bash
   python hp_ai_studio_integration.py --register
   ```

2. **What happens during registration**:
   - The script connects to the MLflow tracking server
   - Finds the latest training run
   - Registers the model with a specified name in the model registry
   - Creates a new version if the model already exists
   - Returns the model version for reference

#### 4. Creating Deployment Configuration

1. **Generate deployment configuration**
   ```bash
   python hp_ai_studio_integration.py --deploy-config
   ```

2. **What happens during configuration**:
   - The script creates a deployment configuration JSON file
   - Includes environment specifications (Python version, dependencies)
   - Defines compute resources (CPU, memory)
   - Specifies API endpoint configuration
   - Includes input/output schemas
   - Saves the configuration to `models/artifacts/deployment_config.json`

### Testing the Integration

To verify your integration is working correctly:

1. **Check MLflow UI**
   - Navigate to your HP AI Studio MLflow UI
   - Verify experiment runs are visible
   - Check that metrics and artifacts are properly logged

2. **Test the registered model**
   - Confirm the model appears in the HP AI Studio model registry
   - Verify the latest version is available

3. **Validate the model locally**
   ```bash
   python test_recommender.py
   ```

### Model Explainability

The SpendingRecommender model includes comprehensive explainability features:

- **Confidence Scores**: Each recommendation includes a confidence score (0-1) indicating the model's certainty
- **Explanation Metadata**: Detailed reasoning for each recommendation, including statistical justification
- **Feature Importance**: Documentation of which features influence recommendations (amount, department, category, vendor)
- **Recommendation Types**: Clear categorization of different recommendation types:
  - `spending_anomaly`: Identifies unusual spending patterns
  - `cost_saving`: Suggests opportunities to reduce costs
  - `vendor_consolidation`: Identifies opportunities to consolidate vendors
  - `budget_optimization`: Suggests better budget allocation
  - `policy_violation`: Flags potential policy violations

### Troubleshooting HP AI Studio Integration

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **MLflow Connection Issues**

   **Symptoms**: `Connection refused` or `Failed to connect to MLflow server`
   
   **Solutions**:
   - Verify your MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI is correct in the .env file
   - Check network connectivity to the HP AI Studio server
   - Ensure your authentication credentials are valid
   - Try using an explicit authentication token if required

2. **Model Training Failures**

   **Symptoms**: `Training failed` or errors during the training process
   
   **Solutions**:
   - Check the logs for specific error messages
   - Verify sample data is available and properly formatted
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
   - Try with a smaller dataset for testing

3. **Model Registration Issues**

   **Symptoms**: `Model registration failed` or `No runs found`
   
   **Solutions**:
   - Ensure you've run the training step first
   - Check permissions to create/modify models in the registry
   - Verify the experiment name is correct
   - Try manually registering the model through the MLflow UI

4. **Deployment Configuration Errors**

   **Symptoms**: `Error creating deployment configuration`
   
   **Solutions**:
   - Ensure the model is properly registered
   - Check write permissions to the artifacts directory
   - Verify the model version exists in the registry

5. **Dependency Conflicts**

   **Symptoms**: Import errors or version mismatch warnings
   
   **Solutions**:
   - Create a clean virtual environment
   - Install dependencies in the correct order
   - Check for conflicting versions in requirements.txt
   - Use `pip list` to verify installed versions

6. **Path Resolution Issues**

   **Symptoms**: `File not found` or path-related errors
   
   **Solutions**:
   - Use absolute paths when necessary
   - Avoid nested directories with the same name
   - Run scripts from the project root directory
   - Check file permissions

#### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Verbose Logging**
   
   Add this to your script before running:
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
   ```

2. **Check MLflow Server Logs**
   
   If you have access to the HP AI Studio server logs, check for connection or authentication issues.

3. **Validate Environment Variables**
   
   Print environment variables to ensure they're loaded correctly:
   ```python
   import os
   print(os.environ.get("MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI"))
   ```

4. **Test MLflow Connection Separately**
   
   Create a simple script to test just the MLflow connection:
   ```python
   import mlflow
   mlflow.set_tracking_uri("your-tracking-uri")
   print(mlflow.list_experiments())
   ```

5. **Check for File Lock Issues**
   
   If you're getting file access errors, ensure no other processes are using the same files.
